# Tailscale Connection Guide for P.DE.I

## Overview

Tailscale creates a secure private network (mesh VPN) between your devices. This allows you to access your P.DE.I Exocortex server running on your desktop from your mobile phone, even if you are not on the same Wi-Fi network, without exposing ports to the public internet.

## 1. Installation

### Desktop (Server Host)

1. Go to [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download).
2. Install the application for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).
3. Log in with your identity provider (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.).
4. Your desktop is now part of the mesh.

### Mobile (Client)

1. Install "Tailscale" from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
2. Log in with the **same account** used on the desktop.
3. Accept the VPN configuration request.
4. Your phone is now part of the mesh.

## 2. Verification

Open the Tailscale app on your phone. You should see your desktop listed with a `100.x.y.z` IP address.

## 3. Connecting to P.DE.I

1. **Start the Server**:
    Run the P.DE.I server on your desktop:

    ```bash
    python main.py --server
    ```

2. **Automatic Detection**:
    The framework will automatically detect your Tailscale IP (starting with `100.`) and display it in the console:

    ```txt
    🔌 Tailscale Detected: 100.x.y.z
    🚀 AI Executive Online: http://0.0.0.0:8000/web
    ```

3. **Access via Mobile**:
    * **QR Code**: If you open `http://localhost:8000` on your desktop browser, the landing page will display a QR code specifically for the Tailscale address. Scan it with your phone.
    * **Direct Link**: On your phone browser, navigate to `http://100.x.y.z:8000/web` (replace `100.x.y.z` with your desktop's Tailscale IP).

## Troubleshooting

* **"Site can't be reached"**: Ensure the Tailscale VPN switch is active on both devices.
* **MagicDNS**: If you have MagicDNS enabled in your Tailscale admin console, you can access the server via `http://machine-name:8000/web` instead of the IP.
