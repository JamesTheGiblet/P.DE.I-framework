# 3. THE LLM TRAINING FACTORY PIPELINE

## From Expert Brain → Fine-Tuned Model

This is the **core competitive advantage** - the system doesn't just assist, it **captures and distills expertise**.

### Phase 1: Expert Interaction (The Work)
**What Happens:**
- Professional operates within BuddAI GUI
- Performs standard work (coding, designing, analyzing)
- AI generates solutions based on current knowledge
- Work proceeds naturally

**Data Captured:**
- Every request and response
- Context and intent
- Generated code/solutions
- User's workflow patterns

### Phase 2: Correction Harvesting (The Learning)
**What Happens:**
- When AI fails or produces suboptimal solution
- User provides: `/correct "reasoning here"`
- System logs:
  - Original flawed output
  - User's corrected version
  - Technical reasoning
  - Context and patterns

**Example Correction:**
```
AI Generated: position += k * (position + 50)
User Corrects: currentSpeed += (targetSpeed - currentSpeed) * k
Reason: "Forge Theory requires TWO variables: current and target. 
        Formula creates exponential convergence to target."
```

**Data Stored:**
```json
{
  "original_code": "position += k * (position + 50)",
  "corrected_code": "currentSpeed += (targetSpeed - currentSpeed) * k",
  "reasoning": "Forge Theory requires TWO variables...",
  "context": "motor_control_smoothing",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-02T06:00:00Z",
  "confidence": 1.0
}
```

### Phase 3: Rule Extraction (The Intelligence)
**What Happens:**
- SmartLearner analyzes corrections
- Identifies patterns across multiple corrections
- Distills human "gut instinct" into structured rules
- Assigns confidence scores
- Creates generalizable patterns

**Example Rule Extraction:**
```
From 5 corrections about Forge Theory:
→ Extracted Rule: "When implementing smoothing/convergence:
   MUST use TWO state variables (current, target)
   Formula: current += (target - current) * k
   k=0.3 aggressive, k=0.1 balanced, k=0.03 graceful
   Applies to: motors, servos, LEDs, temp control, all smoothing"
   
Confidence: 0.95 (derived from 5 consistent corrections)
Category: forge_theory_core
Priority: CRITICAL
```

### Phase 4: JSONL Export (The Training Data)
**What Happens:**
- ModelFineTuner prepares data for LLM training
- Formats into instruction-following format
- Creates system prompts with domain context
- Generates training/validation splits

**Example JSONL Entry:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are James-Qwen, an expert in embedded systems and robotics with 8+ years of experience. You use Forge Theory (exponential decay smoothing) as your core methodology for all control problems."
    },
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "Generate motor control with smooth speed ramping"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "```cpp\n// Motor Control with Forge Theory Smoothing\nfloat currentSpeed = 0.0;\nfloat targetSpeed = 255.0;\nconst float k = 0.1;  // Balanced convergence\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if (millis() - lastUpdate >= 20) {\n    lastUpdate = millis();\n    currentSpeed += (targetSpeed - currentSpeed) * k;\n    analogWrite(ENA, (int)currentSpeed);\n  }\n}\n```"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 5: Model Fine-Tuning (The Transformation)
**What Happens:**
- Base model (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder) is fine-tuned
- Trained on domain-specific JSONL dataset
- Learns expert's patterns natively (not retrieval)
- Creates specialized model (James-Qwen, Pharma-Qwen, etc.)

**Training Process:**
```bash
# Local training with Ollama
ollama create james-qwen -f Modelfile

# Or cloud training for larger models
python train_lora.py \
  --base_model qwen2.5-coder-14b \
  --dataset corrections.jsonl \
  --output james-qwen-v1 \
  --epochs 3 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5
```

**Result:**
- Specialized model that "thinks" like the expert
- Native understanding of domain patterns
- Automatic application of methodologies
- No retrieval lag (knowledge is in weights)

### Phase 6: Native Intelligence (The Product)
**What You Get:**
- Domain-specific LLM that inherits expert intuition
- Generates code/solutions in expert's style automatically
- Applies proprietary methodologies (e.g., Forge Theory) natively
- Preserves 8+ years of expertise in model weights

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Generic LLM | RAG System | Fine-Tuned Expert Model |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| Speed | Fast | Slow (retrieval) | Fast |
| Domain Knowledge | Generic | Retrieved | Native |
| Methodology | None | Referenced | Applied Automatically |
| Style Consistency | Random | Variable | Perfect Match |
| Offline Capable | Yes | No | Yes |
